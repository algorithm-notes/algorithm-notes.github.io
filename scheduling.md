The chances of Leon to get a girl after a lengthy conversation is , where  (Probably closer to 100000). There are  girls whom Leon wants to hook up with, where .(man is pretty desperate). To gain this  chance, Leon must talk to the  girl between  and  units of time. Since this uses up his only brain cell, he cannot talk to multiple girls at the same time. Leon does not care which girl he hooks up with (beggars canâ€™t be choosers), but he wants to maximise his total chance to get a girlfriend.
