You are helping out your mate Leon Wang. As we all know, it is physically impossible for informaticians to get girls. However, the maths geek Leon Wang has a slight chance. The chances of Leon to get a girl after a lengthy conversation is \(\frac{1}{p}\), where \(2 \leq p \leq 100000\) (Probably closer to 100000). There are \(N\) girls whom Leon wants to hook up with, where \(1 \leq N \leq 1000000\).(man is pretty desperate). To gain this \(\frac{1}{p}\) chance, Leon must talk to the \(i^{th}\) girl between \(A_i\) and \(B_i\) units of time. Since this uses up his only brain cell, he cannot talk to multiple girls at the same time. Leon does not care which girl he hooks up with (beggars canâ€™t be choosers), but he wants to maximise his total chance to get a girlfriend.
