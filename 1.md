# Part 1: Basics

## 1.0	Introduction
The vastness of the informatics landscape renders it a convoluted subject for beginners. 

## 1.1	Greedy
Greedy algorithms are the most simple algorithms in Competitive programming. However, due to their unique nature it often goes hand in hand with proofs.

The first step in trying to solve a competitive programming example is always to simplify. Problems usually have lengthy flavour-texts that barely affect the actual problem. As such, it is useful to apply abstraction and simplify a problem to the mathematical core.

With a simplified problem, the informatician’s next step is to play around with observations and ideas. At this stage, a move may be found that seems to always move the current state in the direction of the optimal. You have just found a greedy approach to this problem.

More formally, a greedy algorithm is one that makes the most seemingly optimal step at each state, in hopes of finding the best solution at the end.

For example, say you are robbing a bank, and there are n bags of gold lying there in front of you. However, you only have time to grab k bags before the police arrive. The greedy solution to this is that you take the largest bag there is k times.

This greedy solution works intuitively. However, more often than not, a greedy algorithm may only take you to a good solution, but is far from the best. For example, consider the case where each bag of gold reveals a bag of different value beneath it. The greedy approach will still be to take the best bag at each moment of time, but this is far from optimal in certain cases.

[insert picture]

It is important to prove a greedy algorithm if it’s not intuitively true. This is because greedy algorithms range from problem to problem and don't have the same guarantee as other algorithms. The most common way to prove a greedy algorithm is through what’s called an exchange argument.
