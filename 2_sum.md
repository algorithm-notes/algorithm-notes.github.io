# 2-sum

These days, Leon Wang is depressed because ***** just broke up with him. There are N girls, whom Leon can hook up with. For each girl, he has decided for her a *rating*. The higher the rating, the happier he would be if he hooked up with that girl. Specifically, Leon’s happiness value is the sum of the girls’ ratings that he hooked up with. Leon has decided to hook up with exactly 2 girls, so that if one broke up with him, he won’t be happy.

“I want a backup,” He smiled.

He wants his happiness value at the end to be exactly K (he’s on a happiness diet). As the slave in his basement, you are forced to help him figure out which girls to pick to achieve a happiness value of exactly K.

On a more detailed note, N can be as large as 1000000; Each rating Leon gave is between -1000 and 1000. His happiness target K is between -1000000000 and 1000000000.
