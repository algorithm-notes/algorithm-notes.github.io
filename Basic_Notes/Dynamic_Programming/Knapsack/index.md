# Knapsack
## Problem statement

TODO: sort out latex writing?

This is the 0-1 knapsack. For the general knapsack problem, you can take an item infinite number of times.

You are a thieve preparing to rob a house. You have a sack that is L (L < 10000) big. There are N (N < 10000) N items in the house. 
Even item has 2 attributes, its value (vi < 1000000) and size (si < 1000000). 

What is the most valued collection of items you can carry back in your L-sized sack? What items shall you take?
