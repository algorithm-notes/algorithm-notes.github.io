# Introduction

## How to use this website

This website is written by three aspiring Informatics students who wish to extend their own skills by collating notes. The intended audience are high school students who wish to enter their countryâ€™s informatics training course and perhaps compete in major competitions such as the IOI.

It is assumed that you know about basic c++ syntax such as:
- Control structures
- Functions
- Variables and arrays
- Stl data structures such as vectors, queues and stacks
- Pointers and iterators
- Have general proficiency in c++ usage

The website will be split into 3 sections: basic, intermediate and advanced. Each section will end on a problem subsection with classic problems that fits in the respective skill groups. Other problems are dispersed throughout the rest of the section.

Disclaimer: At the time of writing, the authors have a modest ability and the advanced section does not include items that are above our skill level. It is recommended that readers familiar with our content look at other areas for knowledge.

Please enjoy and good luck with competitive programming.

*Note*: Even though we are a guide on competitive programming, our main purpose is to help students in informatics programs. As such, we will try not to deviate from the [IOI syllabus](https://people.ksp.sk/~misof/ioi-syllabus/ioi-syllabus.pdf), and any subjects outside this curriculum will be marked as such.
