## Prerequisites
These notes assumes the reader knows basic c++ (python is fine as well) syntax including:
- Basic control structures
- Functions, structures
- Variables, arrays
- Vectors, queues, stacks (stl)
- Pointers, pointer arithematic
- Fluency in c++

The reader should know how to calculate complexity and estimate the amount of time the program will take.

Other programming languages such as Python is fine, but c++ is strongly recommended for informatics students. Our example code will be in c++.
Some problems, you even need python because it has big integers etc., something you have to code in c++ yourself and takes a time too long.

You should also have a [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) account as you may wish to do some example problems for practise.

Some problems may be from POJ, or [orac](http://orac.amt.edu.au/cgi-bin/train/hub.pl), which is extremely popular :).
