# Algorithm Notes for Competitive Programming

#### A site dedicated to notes for Competitive Programming. Written by **Jerry Li** and **Arthur Sun**

## Prerequisites
These notes assumes the reader knows basic c++ (c++ is better than python) syntax including:
- Basic control structures
- Functions
- Variables, arrays
- Vectors, queues, stacks

The reader should know how to calculate complexity and estimate the amount of time the program will take.

Other programming languages such as Python is fine, but c++ is strongly recommended for informatics students. Our example code will be in c++.

You should also have a Codeforces account as you may wish to do some example problems for practise.

Some problems may be from POJ.
